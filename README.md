# OpenFoodFacts
Demonstrate ability to clean and prepare a dataset, formulate interesting questions and answering them by exploring relationships between variables. 

The Open Food Facts project is a collaborative, free and open food database gathering information and data on food products from around the world. While the project originated in France in 2012, it has since been extended worldwide. Contributions to the database can be entered by anyone, based on information explicitely shown on food packages. These info include:

- generic name,
- quantity,
- type of packaging,
- brand,
- category,
- manufacturing or processing locations,
- countries and stores where the product is sold,
- list of ingredients,
- any traces (for allergies, dietary laws or any specific diet),
- food additives
- nutritional information.
In addition to fields completed by users, the data also contains:

- machine computed fields such as the name of the contributor or the date of the contribution
- composite fields based on the other data fields, such as the nutrition score for example.
As of today, the database contains entries for more than 1,000,000 food products, from more than 150 countries.

The goal for this project is to explore the dataset and analyze the relationships between the different variables and discover underlying connections.
